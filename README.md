# OOPAssignment1
This is my first assignment for advance object oriented programmig
In this project I created a graphical user interface and save them on local database.
When my application would be launched it would firstly show the contacts and my contact would be on the top of the list.
In this application user can search the existing contact, edit the information as well as can create a new contact by using search , edit and create new contact respectively.
To make my application more interesting i used CSS so if in "create new contact" user miss any information I will show red errors.
